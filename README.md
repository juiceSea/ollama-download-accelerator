# ollama-download-accelerator
Ollama often starts with very high download speeds initially, but the speed tends to drop significantly later, sometimes to less than 1MB/s, which becomes extremely time-consuming. This project leverages Ollama's breakpoint resumption mechanism to help maintain sustained high-speed downloads.
